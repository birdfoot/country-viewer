## About

This is a personal project used for learning pre-rendering using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), testing using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and various other things.
It is based on the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
